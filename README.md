## Insights
1. There are a couple ingredients that need to be restocked
2. Seafood pizzas are the most expensive pizzas by cost
3. Orders peak around 1pm and 7pm (lunch and dinner time)
4. Caesar salad is the highest revenue after pizza
5. Average order value is high so maybe focus on increasing orders

## Recommendations
1. Always restock when there is less than 25% left
2. Add more salads or improve Caesar Salad to get more sales 
3. Have more staff on during peak hours and less during less busy hours
4. Try to have some advertisements outside of the center of Manchester to the outer regions of the city
